"""
Test environment for the backend suite.

`talleyrand.core.config` builds its Settings the moment it is imported, so
every test module that touches the package needs a complete configuration
before pytest can even collect it. Setting one here lets the suite run from a
fresh clone with no .env file and no Google Cloud project, and pins the tests
to a known configuration instead of whatever the developer happens to have
locally.

Environment variables win over the .env file, so anything a test asserts on
must be set here — otherwise the same test passes on the host and fails in
Docker, which sets a different value. These values are placeholders. Nothing in
the suite talks to Google or signs a token anyone outside the test process will
see.
