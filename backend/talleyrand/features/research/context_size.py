"""
How much of a model's window the next question would take.

The composer shows a meter of it. Counting client-side from characters is not
good enough: the same characters are one token or three depending on the
script and the tokenizer, and a case measured at 44% of the window by
characters was 142% of it by tokens (2026-09-14). So the count is made here,
by the counter the request will be judged by — tiktoken for OpenAI models,
Anthropic's token-counting endpoint for Claude models — on the prompt the
answer would be built from: the saved case with the draft filed as a new
question.
