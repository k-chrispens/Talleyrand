"""
Job-record overlay: the ownership boundary between client saves and server jobs.

A completed job record is authoritative for its result until the client proves
incorporation. Every graph read folds unacknowledged results in; every save
folds them into the incoming payload, so a client holding pre-completion state
can never overwrite a server-side result.

Acknowledgement per kind:
- answer: implicit — a payload whose response for the node equals the record's
  answer proves incorporation (works for the research client and the legacy
  canvas alike, which never sends explicit acks).
- suggestions/big_picture: explicit ackedJobIds on the save, sent by the client
  only after the suggestions entered its store. Until then the overlay
  re-appends them; afterwards the payload itself carries their (possibly
  mutated: aged, accepted, declined) state.
- cheat_sheet: explicit ackedJobIds too. A completed sheet is newer than
  anything the payload can carry (a refresh regenerates in place, so the
  payload still holds the previous sheet), so an unacked record simply
  overwrites. A failed or interrupted one retires carrying nothing: a cheat
  sheet has no retry affordance — the header falls back to the thread itself.
