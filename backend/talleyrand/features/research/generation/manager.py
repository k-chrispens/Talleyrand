"""
In-memory runtime for generation jobs.

One process-global manager owns every running job task, the per-user background
queue, and the per-graph event channels. Job results are persisted as records
(records.py); the runtime holds only what must not be persisted (API keys) or
is reconstructible (stream buffers).

Ordering guarantees relied upon by the protocol:
- registry entries are inserted synchronously before the first await of a start,
  so a concurrent start or a /jobs read can never observe a half-started job;
- channel attach snapshots and subscribes in one synchronous block, and chunk
  append + broadcast happen without an await in between, so a view receives
  every chunk exactly once (snapshot covers the past, the queue the future).
