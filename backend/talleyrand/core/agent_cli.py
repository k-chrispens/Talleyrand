"""
Running a signed-in agent CLI (Claude Code, Hermes) as one model call.

Shared by core/claude_code.py and core/hermes.py. Each call is one process
that runs on the operator's own subscription instead of an API key, and only
in a local session (settings.local_mode): a hosted deployment never spawns a
CLI, whatever model a request names. What every backend gets from here:

- the prompt over stdin, never through a shell;
- a fixed empty working directory, so no project context attaches;
- an environment of a handful of variables, never the server's own: an
  inherited ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY would silently bill the run to
  an API instead of the subscription;
- one concurrency cap across backends, since calls share a usage window;
- output read as it is printed, so a backend can stop a run at the first
  event that shows it is not what it should be (API-key auth, tools), before
  the model is called or a tool finishes;
- a timeout, and on timeout, refusal or cancellation (a deleted question, a
  forced retry, shutdown) the whole process group killed before the error
  propagates.
