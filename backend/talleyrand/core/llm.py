"""
LLM access shared by every feature.

stream_text dispatches streaming chat queries to OpenAI (Responses API) or
Anthropic (Messages API) based on the selected model's provider; it is used by
the node-query services. It yields the answer as TextChunks interleaved with
the SourceChunks describing what its web searches turned up. parse_structured
is the one-shot structured-output call (OpenAI) used by kickstart, the
suggesters, reports, and auto-naming.

In a local session both can run on the operator's own signed-in agent CLI
instead (core/claude_code.py, core/hermes.py): answers for questions set to the
"claude-code" or "hermes" preset, and every structured call, whatever model its
feature names, on settings.agent_backend.
