"""
Model calls through the operator's own signed-in Claude Code (`claude -p`).

Each call runs on the operator's Claude subscription (process handling in
core/agent_cli.py), made as close to plain inference as the CLI allows: no
tools, no MCP servers, no skills, and none of the operator's own settings,
hooks, plugins or CLAUDE.md (--safe-mode), so nothing but Talleyrand's prompt
shapes the answer and nothing in a case can make it act.

What a run may do is set by those flags and by the environment it starts with
(core/agent_cli.py passes no API keys). The CLI's first event reports what the
run actually got, and a run that reports tools or API-key auth is killed at
that event, with no grace period. That is a fast stop, not a guarantee: the
CLI does not wait for the check, so a call it starts within a millisecond or
two of printing the event still goes out. A run that never reports its setup
is not trusted either. The CLI's contract was
checked against Claude Code 2.1.280 on 2026-09-23 (see PLAN.md).
