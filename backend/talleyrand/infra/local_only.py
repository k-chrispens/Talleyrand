"""
The boundary that replaces sign-in in local mode (see main.apply_local_mode).

With every request signed in as the operator, what keeps strangers out has to
come from the request itself, not from how the server was launched:

- the peer must be this machine. A remote client is refused whatever Host
  header it sends, even if the server was bound to every interface;
- a state-changing request (anything but GET/HEAD/OPTIONS, and every
  WebSocket) that a browser marks as coming from another origin is refused. A
  page can POST without a CORS preflight (no Content-Type, text/plain, a form),
  and CORS only hides the response, so without this any site the operator
  visits could spend their subscription or write to their cases. Browsers send
  Origin on every cross-origin POST; a request without one comes from a local
  tool, not a page.

TrustedHostMiddleware stays alongside: it is what stops a DNS-rebinding page,
whose requests look same-origin, from reading anything.
